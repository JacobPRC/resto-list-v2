# RestoList

RestoList is an app for keeping track of restaurants you have and want to eat at

## Features

- List restaurants you want to eat at

- Move restaurants from your list of want to try to a list of tried ones

- Filter your list by category. IE all Chinese restaurants in one list, all of the 5 star restaurants in your try list, etc

- Choose a restaurant for you. In a specific list or subsection of a list (like example above), it will randomly choose N restaurants from the list to help you decide where to eat!

## Roadmap

# What are the current goals of this app and what would I like to accomplish?

# Current goal:

Create a minimum viable product. The base case of this app is to sign in, have a list of tried and want to try restaurants with CRUD functionality. After that implement filtering.

# Future goals:

- Be able to have multiple lists, most likely implementation is for different cities. And maybe an optional list for cafes?

- Add a forum for users to discuss and recommend restaurants/food. Similar to Reddit for food recommendations

- Make into a mobile app as well as a web app
